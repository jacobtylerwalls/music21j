/**
 *
 * Based on music21, Copyright (c) 2006-20, Michael Scott Cuthbert and cuthbertLab
 * The plan is to implement all core music21 features as Javascript and to expose
 * more sophisticated features via server-side connections to remote servers running the
 * python music21 (music21p).
 *
 * Requires an ECMAScript 5 compatible browser w/ SVG and Canvas. IE 11 or any recent
 * version of Firefox, Safari, Edge,  Chrome, etc. will do.
 *
 * All interfaces are alpha and may change radically from day to day and release to release.
 * Do not use this in production code yet.
 *
 * music21j acknowledges VexFlow, MIDI.js in particular for their great efforts without which
 * this module would not be possible.
 *
 * @namespace music21
 * @exports music21
